I am not alive so thats quite the complex phylosophical debate, anyway, if you'd like me to be of service you can use the following commands:\n\n*?insult @person_to_insult* - Be aware. I am ruthless.\n*?play/add* link_youtube_song - I will be judging your music taste not so silently.\n*?stop* - So we won't have to endure anymore of your outrageous music.\n*?search_song* name of said song - I will try my best to find it on youtube, sadly, youtube sucks.\n\n Oh, one more thing! DON'T YOU DARE OFFEND MY MASTER! She's the most noble human being of this despicable kind of yours."
